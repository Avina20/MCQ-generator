The problem statement undertaken is with regard to the children in the age group of 7-14 years, to enhance the learning experience and cultivate a desire of learning, and aid the teachers and the parents. I aim to develop an application that will create an objective questionnaire from a sample text (ex. a lesson or a chapter) to test the knowledge and understanding of the child with respect to the said text using natural language processing and neural networks. To develop an application that prepares a questionnaire based on a text fed into it and grades it. Based on the score obtained, it assigns the pass/fail status.

Nowadays, teachers/professors/tutors spend a lot of time generating test papers and quizzes manually. Similarly, students spend a lot of time on self-analysis. Moreover, students are dependent on their mentors for the self-analysis. Hence, I am working on this NLP project, which has a huge scope of development at this moment. We want to build a computer application system that can help you in calibrating yourself and remove any dependencies on mentors. So this project is relevant to both students and mentors.
